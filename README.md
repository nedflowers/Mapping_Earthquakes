# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Project
Visualize the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request; create 3 different styles of maps and include interactive layers for location markers and tectonic plate boundaries.
